# Malware-analysis-tool
Creating a malware analysis GUI tool in Kali Linux can be quite involved, but I can guide you through a simple framework using Python with Tkinter for the GUI and some basic functionality. Below are the steps you can follow:

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Install Python and Tkinter: Ensure you have Python installed on your Kali Linux system. Tkinter is usually included with Python installations, but you can install it with:


sudo apt-get install python3-tk
Install Required Libraries: You might need additional libraries for analysis. For example, pefile for PE file analysis.


pip install pefile
Step 2: Basic GUI Setup
Create a basic GUI using Tkinter. Open your terminal and create a new Python file:


nano malware_analysis_gui.py
Step 3: Write the Basic GUI Code
(The code is in py.main file )

Step 4: Run Your Application
Save the file and exit the editor.

Run your application:


python3 malware_analysis_gui.py
Step 5: Extend Functionality
You can extend your tool by adding more analysis features:

Static Analysis: Extract file headers, import tables, etc.
Dynamic Analysis: Integrate with a sandbox environment.
Network Analysis: Monitor network traffic of analyzed files.
Database Integration: Store results for future reference.
Step 6: Security Considerations
Run in a Safe Environment: Always analyze malware in a controlled and isolated environment to avoid potential threats.
User Permissions: Ensure proper permissions and user rights are in place.
